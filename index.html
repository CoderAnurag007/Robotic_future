                            can follow faces , sustain eye contact and recognize individuals.It can process speech and

                            conversations using a natural language subsystem. Around 2018 Sophia upgraded her

                            adding legs that led her to walk. CNBC has commented on Sophia's "lifelike" skin and its

                            Agency (DARPA). The robot was initially designed for a variety of search and rescue tasks,
                            and was unveiled to the public on July 11, 2013
                            Atlas is intended to aid emergency services in search and rescue operations, performing
                            tasks such as shutting off valves, opening doors and operating powered equipment in
                            environments where humans could not survive.[1] The Department of Defense stated in 2013
                            that it had no interest in using the robot for offensive or defensive warfare.

                            laboratories for research and education purposes. It was released to institutions in 2008,
                            and was made publicly available by 2011. Various upgrades to the Nao platform have since

                            squeezing through hard to reach places. the sole aim of the prototype is to act as a search

                            survivors by delivering them water. the snake starts as a rolled up inside out tube with a
                            pump on one end and a camera positioned on the other side. once initiated, the device
                            inflates and grows in the direction of the camera, while the other side stays the same.
